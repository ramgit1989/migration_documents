exit

##Set postgres Password

By default, there is no password assigned to the Postgres user. For security reasons, it is a good idea to set a strong password for the Postgres user.

First, log in to PostgreSQL with the following command.

su - postgres

###Once logged in, set a password to Postgres user.

psql -c "alter user postgres with password 'securepassword'"

Finally, exit from the Postgres Shell with the following command.
Connect to a Database

####To begin, we connect to a database using the psql command, specifying the username and database name:

psql -U username -d dbname

Replace username with your PostgreSQL username and dbname with the desired database name.
Database Operations

###Create a Database. This command establishes a new database named dbname.

CREATE DATABASE dbname;

###Delete a Database

DROP DATABASE dbname;

note---This command permanently removes a specified database.
##Table Operations

###Create a table .

CREATE TABLE tablename (
  column1 datatype1,
  column2 datatype2,
  ...
);

###Data Manipulation

###Insert Data.

INSERT INTO tablename (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

##This command inserts new data into specified columns of a table.
Update Data

UPDATE tablename SET column = value WHERE condition;

###Use this command to update existing data based on a specified condition.
Delete Data

DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition;

###This command removes data from a table based on specified criteria.

###Configure PostgreSQL for Remote Access

###By default, PostgreSQL is accessible only from the local system. You can allow remote access by editing the PostgreSQL configuration file.

nano /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

Change the line listen_addresses='*' . and then find the following line.

# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            ident
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 ident

Replace them with the

# Accept from anywhere
host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

Or just change the ident to md5.

    ident: Relies on OS user identity, less secure.
    md5: Uses encrypted passwords, more secure.

Restaring the postgresql service systemctl restart postgresql

###Commonly used postgresql datatypes:

    INT, SMALLINT: whole number. There is no UNSIGNED attribute in PostgreSQL.
    SERIAL: auto-increment integer (AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL).
    REAL, DOUBLE: single and double precision floating-point number.
    CHAR(n) and VARCHAR(n): fixed-length string of n characters and variable-length string of up to n characters. String literals are enclosed by single quotes, e.g., 'Peter', 'Hello, world'.
    NUMERIC(m,n): decimal number with m total digits and n decimal places (DECIMAL(m,n) in MySQL).
    DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL: date and time.
    User-defined types.
    NULL: A special value indicates unknown value or no value (of an optional field), which is different from 0 and empty string (that represent known value of 0 and empty string). To test for NULL value, use operator IS NULL or IS NOT NULL (e.g., email IS NULL). Comparing two NULLs with = or != results in unknown.

At last, Here are a few less commonly known and potentially advanced PostgreSQL commands:

###COPY command with Programmatic Data Loading:

    Description: COPY is often used for bulk data loading, but it can also execute a program to generate the data to be loaded.
    Usage: COPY table_name FROM PROGRAM 'generator_program'.

###pg_trgm Extension for Trigram Matching:

    Description: The pg_trgm extension provides trigram-based similarity measurement for text columns.
    Usage: CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm; and then utilize functions like similarity() for similarity comparisons.

##pg_stat_statements for SQL Query Profiling:

    Description: pg_stat_statements is a module that records normalized queries and their execution statistics.
    Usage: After enabling, query statistics can be queried using SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements;.

##TABLESAMPLE for Random Sampling:

    Description: TABLESAMPLE allows you to select a random sample of rows from a table.
    Usage: SELECT * FROM table TABLESAMPLE BERNOULLI(10); to get a 10% random sample.

RETURNING Clause with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE:

    Description: The RETURNING clause allows you to return values generated by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE command.
    Usage: INSERT INTO table_name ... RETURNING column_name;.
